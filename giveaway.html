                                    <p>Please read this section carefully. It affects Entrant’s rights and will have a
                                        substantial impact on how claims Entrant and Sponsor have against each other are
                                        resolved. Except where prohibited, Entrant agrees that: (1) whenever Entrant has
                                        a disagreement with Sponsor arising out of, connected to, or in any way related
                                        to these Official Rules and/or the Promotion, Entrant will send a written notice
                                        to Sponsor (“Demand”). Entrant agrees that the requirements of this section will
                                        apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before Entrant participated in
                                        the Promotion. Entrant must send any Demand to the following address (the
                                        “Notice Address”): Bloomin’ Brands, Inc., Attn: Chief Legal Officer, 2202 N.
                                        West Shore Blvd., Suite 500, Tampa, FL 33607; (2) Entrant will not take any
                                        legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until ten
                                        (10) business days after Entrant sends this Demand. If Sponsor does not resolve
                                        this disagreement to Entrant’s satisfaction within ten (10) business days, and
                                        Entrant intends on taking legal action, Entrant agrees that Entrant will file a
                                        demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).
                                        Please note that for any such filing of a demand for arbitration, Entrant must
                                        affect proper service under the rules of the AAA, and that notice to the Notice
                                        Address may not suffice. If, for any reason, the AAA is unable to provide the
                                        arbitration, Entrant may file his/her case with any national arbitration
                                        company. The arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes
                                        Supplementary Procedure as effective September 15, 2005. Entrant agrees that the
                                        arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute Entrant
                                        has with Sponsor. Entrant understands that the Federal Arbitration Act allows
                                        for the enforcement of arbitration agreements, and Entrant agrees that it
                                        applies; (3) Entrant will not file any lawsuit against Sponsor in any state or
                                        federal court. Entrant waives any right to a trial by a jury or a state or
                                        federal judge. Entrant agrees that if Entrant does sue Sponsor in state or
                                        federal court, and Sponsor brings a successful motion to compel arbitration,
                                        Entrant must pay all fees and costs incurred by Sponsor in court, including
                                        reasonable attorney’s fees. Entrant will not file a class action or collective
                                        action against Sponsor, and Entrant will not participate in a class action or
                                        collective action against Sponsor. Entrant will not join his/her claims to those
                                        of any other person; (4) Notwithstanding any other provision in these Official
                                        Rules, if this class action waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to
                                        arbitrate is null and void, as though it were never entered into. Any dispute at
                                        that time in arbitration will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled
                                        exclusively in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
                                        Florida, Tampa Division, or in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County,
                                        Florida. Under no circumstances does Entrant or Sponsor agree to class or
                                        collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in arbitration;
                                        (5) any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to actual
                                        out-of-pocket costs incurred, including costs associated with entering this
                                        Promotion, but in no event attorneys’ fees; and (6) under no circumstances will
                                        Entrant be permitted to obtain awards for, and Entrant hereby waives all rights
                                        to claim, indirect, punitive, incidental and consequential damages and any other
                                        damages, other than for actual out-of-pocket expenses, and any and all rights to

                                    <h4>12. DISPUTES:</h4>
                                    <p>Please read this section carefully. It affects Entrant’s rights and will have a
                                        substantial impact on how claims Entrant and Sponsor have against each other are
                                        resolved. Except where prohibited, Entrant agrees that: (1) whenever Entrant has
                                        a disagreement with Sponsor arising out of, connected to, or in any way related
                                        to these Official Rules and/or the Promotion, Entrant will send a written notice
                                        to Sponsor (“Demand”). Entrant agrees that the requirements of this section will
                                        apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before Entrant participated in
                                        the Promotion. Entrant must send any Demand to the following address (the
                                        “Notice Address”): Bloomin’ Brands, Inc., Attn: Chief Legal Officer, 2202 N.
                                        West Shore Blvd., Suite 500, Tampa, FL 33607; (2) Entrant will not take any
                                        legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until ten
                                        (10) business days after Entrant sends this Demand. If Sponsor does not resolve
                                        this disagreement to Entrant’s satisfaction within ten (10) business days, and
                                        Entrant intends on taking legal action, Entrant agrees that Entrant will file a
                                        demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).
                                        Please note that for any such filing of a demand for arbitration, Entrant must
                                        affect proper service under the rules of the AAA, and that notice to the Notice
                                        Address may not suffice. If, for any reason, the AAA is unable to provide the
                                        arbitration, Entrant may file his/her case with any national arbitration
                                        company. The arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes
                                        Supplementary Procedure as effective September 15, 2005. Entrant agrees that the
                                        arbitrator will have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute Entrant
                                        has with Sponsor. Entrant understands that the Federal Arbitration Act allows
                                        for the enforcement of arbitration agreements, and Entrant agrees that it
                                        applies; (3) Entrant will not file any lawsuit against Sponsor in any state or
                                        federal court. Entrant waives any right to a trial by a jury or a state or
                                        federal judge. Entrant agrees that if Entrant does sue Sponsor in state or
                                        federal court, and Sponsor brings a successful motion to compel arbitration,
                                        Entrant must pay all fees and costs incurred by Sponsor in court, including
                                        reasonable attorney’s fees. Entrant will not file a class action or collective
                                        action against Sponsor, and Entrant will not participate in a class action or
                                        collective action against Sponsor. Entrant will not join his/her claims to those
                                        of any other person; (4) Notwithstanding any other provision in these Official
                                        Rules, if this class action waiver is invalidated, then the agreement to
                                        arbitrate is null and void, as though it were never entered into. Any dispute at
                                        that time in arbitration will be dismissed without prejudice and refiled
                                        exclusively in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
                                        Florida, Tampa Division, or in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County,
                                        Florida. Under no circumstances does Entrant or Sponsor agree to class or
                                        collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of claims in arbitration;
                                        (5) any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to actual
                                        out-of-pocket costs incurred, including costs associated with entering this
                                        Promotion, but in no event attorneys’ fees; and (6) under no circumstances will
                                        Entrant be permitted to obtain awards for, and Entrant hereby waives all rights
                                        to claim, indirect, punitive, incidental and consequential damages and any other
                                        damages, other than for actual out-of-pocket expenses, and any and all rights to
                                        have damages multiplied or otherwise increased. All issues and questions
                                        concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of
                                        these Official Rules, or the rights and obligations of the Entrant and Sponsor
                                        in connection with the Promotion, shall be governed by, and construed in
                                        accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to any

                                        other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any
