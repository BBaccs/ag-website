                        have been provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify the identity of the
                        requestor and the validity of the request.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some PI we maintain about Consumers (e.g., clickstream data) is not sufficiently associated with
                        enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able
                        to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s PI. Accordingly, we will not include such
                        information in response to Consumer requests. If we
                        cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required
                        to create an account with us to make a
                        verifiable request, but you may use your account to do so. We will use PI provided in your
                        request to verify your identity or authority
                        to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also provided the PI
                        to us for another purpose.

                    <p>We may collect, use, and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law. Please note
                        we are not obligated to comply with Consumer
                        requests to the extent that doing so would infringe on our, or any other person’s or party’s

                        period prior to your request date. Consumer requests of this nature may be made no more than
                        twice in a 12-month period.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>• The categories of PI we have collected about you.</li>

                        <li>• The business or commercial purposes for collecting or Selling your PI.</li>
                        <li>• The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your PI.</li>
                        <li>• The specific pieces of PI we have collected about you.</li>
                        <li>• A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or
                            that no disclosure occurred.</li>
                        <li>• A list of the categories of PI Sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no Sale
                            occurred. If we Sold your PI, we will explain:

                                <li style="margin-right: 5px;"> • The categories of your PI we have Sold.</li>

                        months prior to the request date, and (2) currently
                        are maintaining. Please note that we retain PI for various time periods in accordance with
                        applicable law and our internal recordkeeping
                        policies and procedures.

                    <h2 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">“Do Not Sell” Rights</h2>
                    <p>While there is not yet a consensus, data practices of third-party cookies and tracking
                        technologies associated with our websites and mobile app
                        may constitute a “Sale” of your PI as defined by the CCPA. You can exercise control over
                        browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on
                        your browser, and mobile devices may offer ad limitation choices. In addition, third party tools
                        may enable you to search for and opt-out of
                        some of these trackers, such as the Ghostery browser plug-in available at <a
                            href="https://www.ghostery.com/" target="_blank">www.ghostery.com</a>. You can learn more
                        about your choices
                        regarding certain kinds of online interest-based advertising in our privacy policy. We do not
                        represent that these third party tools, programs
                        or statements are complete or accurate, clearing cookies or changing settings may affect your
                        choices and you may have to opt-out separately via
                        each browser and other device you use.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do not track signals, but we do not
                        understand them to operate in that manner or to
                        represent a “do not sell” request by you; accordingly, currently we do not view these signals as
                        a do not sell request. We understand that
                        various parties are developing do not sell signals and we may recognize certain such signals if
                        we conclude such a program is appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>We do not knowingly Sell the PI of Consumers. All consumers, regardless of age, may opt out of
                        our promotional emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ link on each of our brand emails. </p>
                    <h2 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Deletion Rights</h2>
                    <p>Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete
                        your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Our retention rights
                        include, without limitation, to complete transactions and service you have requested, for
                        security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business
                        records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law
                        enforcement.</p>
                    <h2 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Non-Discrimination and Financial Incentive Programs</h2>
                    <p>We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your
                        CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or
                        quality of goods or services, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of
                        the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection,
                        Sale, retention, and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA; such offers may result in
                        reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial
                        incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. For details of our current
                        financial incentive program and its terms, including how to opt-in or withdraw your opt-in,
                        program benefits, refer to DineRewards Terms and Conditions. </p>
                    <p>Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional; participants
                        affirmatively opt into the program, and can opt out of the program (i.e., terminate
                        participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) by following the instructions in the program’s
                        description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting a
                        notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above, so check them regularly. </p>
